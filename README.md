# tools_assessmnent_hervk_SR-WGS

This repo contains all of the code and supplementary data used for the paper: An assessment of bioinformatics tools for the detection of human endogenous retroviral insertions in short-read genome sequencing data. 

The supplementary files contain HERV loci used for comparison against results given by each of the tools when applied to 50 SR-WGS samples. S1 = 40 polymorphic HERV-Ks, S2 = UCSC Repeatmasker HERV-KS, S3 = UCSC Repeatmasker all ERV/LTR elements.

The simulation file contains the script for generating simulated genome data with 19 known, non-reference HERV-K (HML-6) insertions.
